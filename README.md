In Search of the Most Amazing Thing

I'm working on an Android port of a classic game from 1983. You can see more information here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Most_Amazing_Thing

I don't have a handle on the copyright situation with the original game, so if you are the owner,
please contact russell@russellglasser.com.
