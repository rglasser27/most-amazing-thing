# In Search of the Most Amazing Thing

I'm working on an Android port of a classic game from 1983. You can see more information here:

I don't have a handle on the copyright situation with the original game, so if you are the owner,
please contact russell@russellglasser.com.

## How to contribute

There is a "to do" list at https://github.com/rglasser27/most-amazing-thing/projects/1. If you would like to contribute,
pick a task and get on it.

### Reading the code as text 
* The original .bas files from the game cannot be read in an ordinary text editor. However, if you load
"Basica" (included in the game files) you can load the source of any file and then resave it as ASCII.
    
        load "intro.bas"
        save "intro.txt",a

### Reference manual for Basic code

This [GWBasic manual](https://hwiegman.home.xs4all.nl/gw-man/index.html) is a fairly reliable reference for the
program code
